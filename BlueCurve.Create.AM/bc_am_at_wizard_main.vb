    'setWindowPos :
    'This function changes the size, position, and z-order of a child, pop-up, or top-level window. Child, pop-up, and top-level windows are ordered according to their appearance on the screen. The topmost window receives the highest rank and is the first window in the z-order.

    ' PARAMETERS    
    'hWnd 
    'Handle to the window. 
    'hWndInsertAfter 
    'Handle to the window to precede the positioned window in the z-order. This parameter must be a window handle or one of the following values: 
    'HWND_BOTTOM 
    'Places the window at the bottom of the z-order. If the hWnd parameter identifies a topmost window, the window loses its topmost status and is placed at the bottom of all other windows. 
    'HWND_NOTOPMOST 
    'Places the window above all non-topmost windows (that is, behind all topmost windows). This flag has no effect if the window is already a non-topmost window. 
    'HWND_TOP 
    'Places the window at the top of the z-order. 
    'HWND_TOPMOST 
    'Places the window above all non-topmost windows. The window maintains its topmost position even when it is deactivated. 
    'For more information about how this parameter is used, see the following Remarks section. 

    'X 
    'Specifies the new position of the left side of the window, in client coordinates. 
    'Y 
    'Specifies the new position of the top of the window, in client coordinates. 
    'cx 
    'Specifies the new width of the window, in pixels. 
    'cy 
    'Specifies the new height of the window, in pixels. 
    'uFlags 
    'Specifies the window sizing and positioning flags. This parameter can be a combination of the following values: 
    'SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS 
    'If the calling thread and the thread that owns the window are attached to different input queues, the system posts the request to the thread that owns the window. This prevents the calling thread from blocking its execution while other threads process the request. 
    'SWP_DEFERERASE 
    'Prevents generation of the WM_SYNCPAINT message. 
    'SWP_DRAWFRAME 
    'Draws a frame (defined in the windows class description) around the window. 
    'SWP_FRAMECHANGED 
    'Sends a WM_NCCALCSIZE message to the window, even if the windows size is not being changed. If this flag is not specified, WM_NCCALCSIZE is sent only when the windows size is being changed. 
    'SWP_HIDEWINDOW 
    'Hides the window. 
    'SWP_NOACTIVATE 
    'Does not activate the window. If this flag is not set, the window is activated and moved to the top of either the topmost or non-topmost group (depending on the setting of the hWndInsertAfter parameter). 
    'SWP_NOCOPYBITS 
    'Discards the entire contents of the client area. If this flag is not specified, the valid contents of the client area are saved and copied back into the client area after the window is sized or repositioned. 
    'SWP_NOMOVE 
    'Retains the current position (ignores the X and Y parameters). 
    'SWP_NOOWNERZORDER 
    'Does not change the owner windows position in the z-order. 
    'SWP_NOREDRAW 
    'Does not redraw changes. If this flag is set, no repainting of any kind occurs. This applies to the client area, the nonclient area (including the title bar and scroll bars), and any part of the parent window uncovered as a result of the window being moved. When this flag is set, the application must explicitly invalidate or redraw any parts of the window and parent window that need redrawing. 
    'SWP_NOREPOSITION 
    'Same as the SWP_NOOWNERZORDER flag. 
    'SWP_NOSIZE 
    'Retains the current size (ignores the cx and cy parameters). 
    'SWP_NOZORDER 
    'Retains the current z-order (ignores the hWndInsertAfter parameter). 
    'SWP_SHOWWINDOW 
    'Displays the window.
